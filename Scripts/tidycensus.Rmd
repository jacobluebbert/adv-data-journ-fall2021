```

Here's the documentation for [tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html#geography-in-tidycensus-1)

Start with a very basic request: population by county
```{r}
county_pop <- get_acs(geography = "county", 
              variables = "B01001_001", 
              state = "MO", 
              year = 2019)
```

Now by place (and you can rename the variable): 
```{r}
place_pop <- get_acs(geography = "place", 
              variables = c(population="B01001_001"), 
              state = "MO", 
              year = 2019)
```

Search for variables:
```{r}
acs2019_var <- load_variables(2019, "acs5", cache=TRUE)

acs2019_var %>% filter(grepl("income", label))
```

Also, you can use data.census.gov to locate the variables you're interested in.
(Search for "plumbing")
```{r}
acs2019_var %>%
  filter(grepl("B25049", name))
```


Try for some more variables (plumbing facilities)
```{r}
plumbing <- get_acs(geography = "place", 
              variables = c("B25049_001", "B25049_002", "B25049_003", "B25049_004", "B25049_005", "B25049_006", "B25049_007"), 
              state = "MO", 
              year = 2019)
```
### CENSUS 2020 ###

Only redistricting data is currently available from the 2020 Census.
If you read the documentation on the tidycensus website, it says that the dataset name for the redistricting data is "pl".

Load the variables file for the redistricting data: 
```{r}

```

Get population by "place" in Missouri:
```{r}

```

More granularly, get population by tract in Boone County:
```{r}

```

Compare to 2010 Census
First get the 2010 population numbers by tract in Boone County:
```{r}

```

Then join the two datasets together:
```{r}

```
